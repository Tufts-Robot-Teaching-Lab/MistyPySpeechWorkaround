# MistyPySpeechWorkaround
The Misty Python SDK is in Beta and not yet full released. The API and python SDK seem to have some problems when getting the Misty to speak. This is a quick work around (and also provides some demo code for examples) to get the Misty to speak. 


Make sure you have installed MistyPy and Misty-SDK
'pip install MistyPy'
'pip install Misty-SDK'

Also, make sure you're on the SAME network as Misty is on! If you used the documentation instructions then the network should be Tufts EECS.
